# Mythware

Mythware is an agile project management software application.

This is a Raw Dessert Recipes website, built using **Flask**, a Python micro-framework. It is a data-driven application, and the target audience is any user who would like to easily access, add new, update and delete recipes.

## UX
The following section describes the UX process for this project.

#### UX Process
1. **Layout** - Reviewed the Code Institute learnings to date and Bootstrap themes to extract design ideas.
2. **User Stories** - Walked through user stories.
    1. **Navbar - Home** - As a user, I want to be able to understand the health benefits of raw desserts and the functionality of this website.
    2. **Navbar - Recipes** - As a user, I want to be able to easily access, update and delete recipes.
    3. **Navbar - New Recipes** - As a user, I want to be able to add new recipes, to contribute to the database of recipes, for other users to access.
    4. **Navbar - Contact** - As a user, I want to be able to contact the website developers to offer feedback and suggestions.
    5. **Footer - Social Links** - As a user, I want to be able to follow Raw Dessert Recipes on social media, to be a part of the raw community and interact with this community online.
3. **Wireframe** - Sketched the wireframe on paper, to include the features for each user story.

## Features

### Existing Features
The following section describes the front-end features in this project.

1. **Navbar - Home** - Provide users with a navbar menu, which brings users to the home page. The home page includes a summary on the health benefits of raw food and a description about the website.
2. **Navbar - Recipes** - Provides users with a navbar menu, which brings users to the recipes page, displaying each recipe title and description on a card. Recipe details can be viewed by selecting 'View Recipe'. The recipe selected is then displayed, which contains a recipe title, description, ingredients, instructions, author and date posted. Users are also provided with an 'Update Recipe' and 'Delete Forever' button, which allows them to update all areas of a recipe or to delete a recipe. A warning message is displayed with a red background, above the Delete Forever and Update Recipe button.
3. **Navbar - New Recipes** - Provides users with a navbar menu, which brings users to the new recipes page. This page displays a blank form and allows users to add new recipes, which are then displayed on the recipes page.
4. **Navbar - Contact** - Provides users with a navbar menu item, which brings users to the contact page. This page displays a blank form, which allows users to contact the website developers to offer feedback and suggestions (not currently wired up to an email address as this is not a real business).
5. **Footer - Social Links** - Provides users with links to the website social media pages (no current social media pages for this project as this is not a real business).

### Features to Implement
1. **Recipe Authors** - Add a feature to include author registration and a separate page showing all recipe authors.
2. **Blog** - Add a feature to include a blog page.
3. **Recipe Image** - Add a feature to upload an image related to the recipe.
4. **Recipe Details** - Add a feature to display recipe ingredients and instructions as lists.
5. **Date picker** - Add a date picker into the 'Date Posted' field, to maintain the same date format throughout.
6. **Search, Sort, Filter, Pagination** - Add these types of features to facilitate the recipe page as it increases in size.
7. **Prep Time** - Add a feature to include prep time.

## Technologies Used
The following section describes all technologies used to construct this project.

        - **Static folder**: All files except the `custom.css`, `bg.jpg`,`intro.jpg` files, were copied from the bootstrap template.
        - **.html files**: All `.html` files used the bootstrap `.html` files as boiler plate code. The project developer then amended and built upon each of these files to suit this project.
        - **gulpfile.js, package-lock.json, package.json files**: Each of these files were included with the bootstrap template.
        - **All Other Code**: Compiled by the project developer.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - This project uses **Flask**, a Python micro-framework. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
- [mLab](https://mlab.com/)
    - This project uses **mLab**, a fully managed cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases. mLab runs on cloud providers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure, and has partnered with platform-as-a-service providers. The developer used an mLab sandbox DB, which is for learning and prototyping. Json value pairs were added into the mLab document to align with the recipe wireframe. For example, 'Recipe_Title: Title', is the json value pair within the mLab database for the Recipe Title.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - This project uses **mongoDB**, a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata.

Bug: Terminal 'run' = ImportError: No module named 'stripe'. Solution = sudo pip3 install stripe.
Bug: Error = django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty = updated settings.py with if os.path.exists('env.py'): import env
Bug: OPEN = Password reset. ERROR = ConnectionRefusedError at /accounts/password-reset/.
Bug: OPEN = Stripe payment not processing. Fix - Will only process when deloyed?
Bug: Travis - failing due to requirements libraries not required/out of date. Failed due to import env code required updating. Travis error - use pip freeze, rather than pip3 freeze.
TemplateDoesNotExist at /accounts/login/ = remove brackets in commentary {% extends "base.html" %}.
AttributeError at /issues/16/ | 'Post' object has no attribute 'views' = Removed post.views += 1 from issues views.py, obsolete code.

Add upvotes.
Add bugs complete per day, week, month with graph/pie chart.
Update coding naming conventions from copied code, to suit this template, eg update blog to issue everywhere.
